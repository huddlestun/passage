<h1>Candle Light</h1>

<p>“With hands numb and bitten by an invisible cold; I sit in the light of infinite candles. Some so close that I could touch them, could feel the warmth of their flames if I were only to reach. Some were barely a glinting presence, far away. I wonder who sat in their presence, whose love and diligence tended their flame, and whose tired frame rested in their light.”</p>
